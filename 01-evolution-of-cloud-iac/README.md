# 01 – Evolution of Cloud & Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

This module focuses on core concepts: how infrastructure evolved and why tools like Terraform exist.

## Topics

- From physical servers → virtualization → cloud
- Why manual configuration doesn't scale
- The rise of DevOps and automation
- What Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is
- Benefits of IaC:
  - Version-controlled infrastructure
  - Reproducible environments
  - Easier collaboration
  - Safer rollouts

> This module has no Terraform code – it sets the mindset for everything in later modules.
