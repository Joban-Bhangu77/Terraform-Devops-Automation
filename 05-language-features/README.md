# 05 – Terraform Language Features

This module demonstrates useful HCL language features through small, focused examples:

- `count` vs `for_each`
- `locals` for computed values
- `dynamic` blocks
- Conditional expressions and built-in functions

Each subfolder contains a separate, minimal example.
